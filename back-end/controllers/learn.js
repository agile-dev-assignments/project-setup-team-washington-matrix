From there, the Queen follows the movement of the opponent's King (if the King goes up one square, the Queen should also go up one square). This will result, in the Queen slowly boxing the King into a corner. The Queen keeps following the opponent's King until the opponent's King only has two squares to move between. From there, the side with the Queen can move its King to a square that can protect the Queen when the Queen moves in to checkmate the other side.",

Afterwards, alternate moving Rooks until the King is forced to the edge of the board which results in a checkmate.
