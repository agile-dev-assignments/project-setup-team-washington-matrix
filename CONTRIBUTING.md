## Team Values and Norms

We want a comfortable and efficient working environment where everyone does their part. Everyone is expected to be respectful and communicate with one another. Some basic expectations of the team include:

    * Attend all sprints on time with updated work
    * Communicate all issues
    * Take responsibility
    * Regularly check communication channels

In the case of any disagreements, we will take the majority vote. If the issue persists, the Stakeholders (aka the professor or graders) will be involved to defuse the situation.

## Git Workflow

We will be using a distributed workflow using branches. Then we will make pull/merge requests to the master/main branch

## Rule of Contribution

Stick to an assigned task and report progress regularly.
