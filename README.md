**For VS Code**

1. Head to Code > Preferences > Extensions and search for the ESCode and Prettier extensions and install them.
2. Make a settings file at .vscode/settings.json and add the following configuration:

```

{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "[jsonc]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[javascriptreact]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace": false,
    "[javascript]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
